#AutoComplete feature using Ternary Search trees in C

**Brief Introduction**
Autocomplete is now seen as a popular feature across Search Engine, Integrated Development Environments and Text Editors where various possible word predictions are given for a partially written text. The Autocomplete allows for further efficiency while perform queries and typing and here we will use a Ternary Search Tree to implement this feature. Ternary Search Tree is regarded as quite efficient compared to the earlier TRIE Data Structure and can perform insertion, deletion and search operation with the same efficiency as a Binary Search Tree. The Space Complexity associated with a Ternary Search Tree is equal to the length of the string that has been stored into it.

**Repository:**
* Datasets
   * words_list.txt - Contains 198,341 words from English Dictionary
* header.h - contains definition of the Ternary search tree node
* implementation.c - contains functions used for implementation of auto-suggest feature 
* driver.c - contains the driver function


**Execution**
* bash driverScript
